2.2-1 θ(n^3)
2.2-2 Consider sorting n numbers stored in array A by first finding the smallest element of A and exchanging it with the element in A[1]. Then find the second smallest element of A, and exchange it with A[2]. Continue in this manner for the first n - 1 elements of A. Write pseudocode for this algorithm, which is known as selection sort. What loop invariant does this algorithm maintain? Why does it need to run for only the first n - 1 elements, rather than for all n elements? Give the best-case and worst-case running times of selection sort in Θ- notation.

A: 
```
for i=1 to A.length
   min <- i
   for j = i + 1 to A.length
      if A[j] < A[min]  then
         min <- j
   tmp <- A[i]
   A[i] <- A[min]
   A[min] <- tmp
```

best case: θ(n^2)
worst case: θ(n^2)

2.2-3 Consider linear search again (see Exercise 2.1-3). How many elements of the input sequence need to be checked on the average, assuming that the element being searched for is equally likely to be any element in the array? How about in the worst case? What are the average-case and worst-case running times of linear search in Θ-notation? Justify your answers.

A: 线性查找，所查元素刚好是遍历时数组当前元素的概率是1/n, 那么平均需要检查

(1 + 2 + ... + n) / n 次 = (n+1) / 2, 时间标记为θ(n)

最坏情况是要查的元素在数组末尾，时间标记为θ(n)
